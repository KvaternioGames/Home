    <h2>Who am i?</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm an independant self taught game developer based in Norway. I've been making games for a couple of months, but never anything commercial until now recently. 
    Personally I'm more of a coder than an artist, i started in middle school. Python was my primary language, but i also learnt some <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 
    and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. In that time i also had my first taste of game development through Scratch. About 2 years later i picked up Unity and started 
    making tiny projects trying to learn more and get better at C#. 6 months later i had begun developing my first commercial project which i'm still working on now</p>
    
    <h2>The Game</h2>
    <p>The type of game i'm making is kinda undecided. Mechanics wise it will be a 2.5D platformer with Arkham-style combat. I'm still itterating the game to come up with unique mechanics.
    As for story i haven't put much time into that either. For now the game remains untitled.</p>
