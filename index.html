    <h1>QuaternioGames</h1>
    <h2>Who am i?</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm an independant self taught game developer based in Norway. I've been making games for a couple of months, but never anything commercial until now recently. 
    Personally I'm more of a coder than an artist, i started in middle school. Python was my primary language, but i also learnt some <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 
    and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. In that time i also had my first taste of game development through Scratch. About 2 years later i picked up Unity and started 
    making tiny projects trying to learn more and get better at C#. 6 months later i had begun developing my first commercial project which i'm still working on now</p>
    
    <h2>The Game</h2>
    <p>Combat, engineering and survial are some of my favorite gameplay mechanics. In my game i wanted to find a rich way to combine all of those elements to create an overall enjoyable experience. 
    The best way that i could describe my vision for the game would be something similar to Slime Ranchers map and farming elements, combined with metroidvaniaesque progression, enemies and combat.
    On top of that also having an engineering system similar to that of redstone in Minecraft, but also with some physics based systems and movement. The game is yet to have a plot, and remains untitled.</p>

    <h2>Content Platforms</h2>
    <p>I'm planning on starting social media for the game later down the line. Which will probably be on YouTube and TikTok, possibly Instagram aswell. The posts will be a blend of promotional material 
    and gamedev based tutorials and tips.
